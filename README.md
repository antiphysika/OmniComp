# OmniComp: Compressed Blocks

OmniComp brings compressed block variants to Minecraft 1.21. No longer will will
your inventory so quickly be filled with cobble when mining, thanks 3-level block
compression. And all you need is a crafting table!

Blocks, items and recipes are provided so that you can, e.g., compress Cobblestone
into Compressed Cobblestone x1 and on up to x3.  Compressed blocks can of course
be decompressed back to the materials used to craft them.

## Supported Minecraft Blocks

So far full support for the following compressed block variants exists:

*   _Dirt_
*   _Coarse Dirt_
*   _Cobblestone_
*   _Mossy Cobblestone_
*   _Stone_
*   _Cobbled Deepslate_
*   _Deepslate_
*   _Gravel_
*   _Sand_
*   _Sandstone_
*   _Andesite_
*   _Diorite_
*   _Granite_
*   _Calcite_
*   _Netherrack_
*   _Soul Sand_
*   _Soul Soil_
*   _End Stone_

...with a good handful more in the works.

And of course, _OmniComp_ wouldn't be a worthy QoL if it did not allow you to
compress all of your hoarded emeralds and diamonds. Who doesn't want copious
amounts of diamond blocks? Mmm, diamonds...
