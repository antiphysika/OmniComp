# OmniComp To-Do List

## Add missing recipes

We're datagen-ing recipes for cobblestone and stone variants but are lacking
all the rest added so far (deepslate, cobbled deepslate, dirt and coarse dirt).

Add recipes for the missing variants.

## Fix placeholder block strench and map colour properties

All blocks added so far have placeholder values for block strengh and map colour
properties.  Pick sane block strength and map colour defaults for the three levels
of compressed blocks.
