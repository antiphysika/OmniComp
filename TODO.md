# OmniComp To-Do List

## Add missing recipes

We're datagen-ing recipes for cobblestone and stone variants but are lacking
all the rest added so far (deepslate, cobbled deepslate, dirt and coarse dirt).

Add recipes for the missing variants.

## Require shovel tool for non-stone blocks

Currently all of our compressed blocks can be mined with a pickaxe, but it
would be in keeping with Vanilla to make the compressed dirt, gravel, sand etc.
blocks require a shovel instead.

## Add reversible shapeless recipes

As it stands, a player can compress 9x cobblestone into a 1x compressed
variant, but it's not possible to reverse the craft and get back those 9
cobblestone from the compressed block.

Time to add reversible recipes.
