## Require shovel tool for non-stone blocks?

Currently all of our compressed blocks can be mined with a pickaxe, but it
would be in keeping with Vanilla to make the compressed dirt, gravel, sand etc.
blocks require a shovel instead.

## Improve logo and other image file assets

The logo as appears on the CF project page is, quite frankly, shit, even
for the 5-minute job that it turned out to be.

Work towards a better logo ASAP and more leisurely, try and improve the
overlay textures as they look a bit too small making especially on darker
textures like Deepslate.

## Upload to Modrinth

The mod exists as a CurseForge project with downloads awaiting moderator
approval.  Once complete, it'd be nice to get it shipped to MR as well.
