# OmniComp To-Do List

## Add missing recipes

We're datagen-ing recipes for cobblestone and stone variants but are lacking
all the rest added so far (deepslate, cobbled deepslate, dirt and coarse dirt).

Add recipes for the missing variants.

## Require shovel tool for non-stone blocks

Currently all of our compressed blocks can be mined with a pickaxe, but it
would be in keeping with Vanilla to make the compressed dirt, gravel, sand etc.
blocks require a shovel instead.
